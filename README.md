# Virtual-Personal-Assistant
## Virtual Personal Assistant with Python

This project is a virtual personal assistant built using Python that utilizes open APIs for various functionalities. The assistant is designed to recognize voice commands and provide responses to user queries. It can perform a range of tasks, such as answering questions, retrieving information from the web, providing weather updates, setting reminders, and more.

### Features

- Voice Recognition: The personal assistant uses voice recognition to listen to user commands, making it convenient and hands-free.
- Open APIs: The assistant integrates with various open APIs to fetch real-time data and perform tasks such as weather updates, news retrieval, language translation, and more.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): The assistant employs NLP techniques to understand user queries more accurately and respond appropriately.
- Modular Design: The project follows a modular design, making it easy to extend the functionality by adding new modules for different tasks.
- User-friendly Interface: The assistant provides a user-friendly and interactive interface for a smooth user experience.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- SpeechRecognition library for voice recognition
- Requests library for making API calls
- Other libraries for specific modules (e.g., pyowm for weather updates)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Usage

1. Run the main Python script to start the virtual personal assistant.
2. The assistant will listen for voice commands. Speak clearly and wait for the response.
3. You can ask the assistant for weather updates, news, general knowledge questions, reminders, and more.
4. The assistant will process your queries and provide appropriate responses.

### Supported Commands

- "Translate [text] to [language]."
- "Set a reminder for [date and time]."
- "Tell me a joke."
- "Who is [person]?"
- "What is [something]?"

## API Keys

To access the APIs used by the assistant (e.g., weather API, news API), you need to obtain API keys from the respective service providers. Update the `config.py` file with your API keys before running the assistant.
